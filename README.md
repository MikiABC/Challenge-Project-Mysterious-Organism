Challenge-Project-Mysterious-Organism
=====================================
Project for Coding Course - Javascript

## Instructions
Context: You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

* Create a factory function (pAequorFactory). The Factory Function must: 
  - simulate a mutation in pAequorFactory()‘s returned object,
  - compare the DNA sequences of different P. aequor,
  - calculate the chance of survival based on how many G and C base pairs the strand contains.
* Create 30 instances of DNA that survive and put them in a container to study later. 
* BONUS CHALLENGE - Add a method to the factory that will create a complimentary strand of DNA.
